We do not store any information long-term, but the following data is accessed when using the bot
- The list of roles in your server.
- The list of roles on every server member (used for detecting unused roles to automatically remove).

We also:
- Watch the server for members who leave, as a part to cleanup unused roles.
- Aggregate anonymous usage stats.

This data remains in a RAM Cache, and lasts as long as Discord.js retains that info by default.
